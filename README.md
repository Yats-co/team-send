## Design

### Optimizations

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
